## Introduction

The **NIS2 Directive** (EU Directive 2022/2555) represents a fundamental shift in the European cybersecurity framework, directly affecting law firms, legal advisory services, and legal departments handling sensitive client information. With EU member states having transposed the regulation in 2024, 2026 marks the critical period of implementation and active supervision by national authorities.

In this article, we analyze the specific obligations for the legal sector, the required technical and organizational measures, and practical steps to ensure regulatory compliance.

## What is the NIS2 Directive?

The NIS2 Directive updates the previous framework (NIS1) by significantly expanding its scope and tightening cybersecurity requirements. Its objective is to raise the common level of cybersecurity across the EU, establishing clear obligations for **essential entities** and **important entities**.

### Scope for Law Firms

Law firms may be affected by NIS2 when they:

- Provide services to **critical sectors** (energy, transport, banking, health, critical infrastructure)
- Have more than **50 employees** or turnover exceeding 10 million euros
- Manage classified information or data with high impact on national security
- Operate as digital service providers with significant market presence

**Important note:** Although not all law firms qualify as regulated entities under NIS2, the **best practices** established by the directive are rapidly becoming the standard of professional diligence required in the legal sector.

## Main Compliance Obligations

### 1. Cybersecurity Risk Management

Affected entities must implement **proportionate and effective** technical, operational, and organizational measures to manage cybersecurity risks. This includes:

#### Mandatory Technical Measures

- **Periodic risk analysis**: Identification and assessment of specific threats
- **Incident management**: Detection, response, and recovery protocols
- **Business continuity**: Backup plans, disaster recovery, and redundant systems
- **Supply chain security**: Due diligence on technology providers
- **Data encryption and protection**: Implementation of cryptography for data in transit and at rest
- **Access controls**: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and privilege management
- **Email security**: Protection against phishing, malware, and data exfiltration

#### Organizational Measures

- **Governance**: Management bodies must approve cybersecurity measures and oversee their implementation
- **Continuous training**: Staff training in cyber hygiene and awareness
- **Security policies**: Documentation of procedures, responsibilities, and workflows
- **Audits**: Periodic evaluations of the effectiveness of implemented measures

### 2. Incident Notification

One of the most significant changes in NIS2 are the **strict incident notification deadlines**:

| Timeline | Required Action |
|----------|----------------|
| **24 hours** | Early warning to national CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team) |
| **72 hours** | Formal notification with initial incident assessment |
| **1 month** | Detailed final report with root cause analysis and corrective measures |

**Notifiable incidents** include:
- Security breaches affecting personal or confidential client data
- Ransomware or malware attacks with operational impact
- Significant interruptions of critical services
- Unauthorized access to sensitive information systems

### 3. Management Liability

NIS2 introduces a novel element: **personal liability** of management body members. Managing partners and directors can be personally sanctioned if they:

- Fail to adequately supervise the implementation of cybersecurity measures
- Do not approve necessary policies and procedures
- Ignore recommendations from audits or risk assessments
- Fail to allocate sufficient resources for compliance

This represents a cultural shift: cybersecurity is no longer purely a technical issue but becomes a **corporate governance responsibility**.

## Practical Steps for Compliance

### Phase 1: Initial Assessment (1-2 months)

1. **Determine applicability**: Is your law firm within the scope of NIS2?
2. **Asset inventory**: Identify critical systems, sensitive data, and technological dependencies
3. **Gap analysis**: Compare current situation vs. regulatory requirements
4. **Responsibility assignment**: Designate a cybersecurity officer or DPO with expanded functions

### Phase 2: Technical Implementation (3-6 months)

1. **Security architecture**:
   - Network segmentation
   - Next-generation firewalls
   - Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS)
   
2. **Endpoint protection**:
   - Enterprise antivirus/EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)
   - Removable device control
   - Centralized update management

3. **Identity management**:
   - Active directory with robust password policies
   - MFA for all remote and administrative access
   - Periodic permission review (principle of least privilege)

4. **Backup and recovery**:
   - 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite copy
   - Quarterly restoration tests
   - Backup encryption

### Phase 3: Organization and Governance (2-3 months)

1. **Documentation**:
   - Information security policy
   - Incident management procedure
   - Business continuity plan
   - Data processing register (GDPR + NIS2)

2. **Training**:
   - Quarterly awareness sessions
   - Phishing simulations
   - Incident response protocols

3. **Contracts and suppliers**:
   - Review security clauses with cloud providers
   - Audit subcontractors accessing critical systems
   - Establish security SLAs

### Phase 4: Monitoring and Continuous Improvement

1. **SIEM or centralized logging**: Real-time security event correlation
2. **Annual audits**: Internal or by specialized third parties
3. **Risk analysis updates**: Minimum biannual review
4. **Incident response exercises**: Annual tabletop simulations

## Penalties for Non-Compliance

National authorities can impose administrative sanctions of up to:

- **Essential entities**: 10 million euros or 2% of global annual turnover
- **Important entities**: 7 million euros or 1.4% of global annual turnover

Additionally, serious non-compliance can result in:
- Temporary ban on exercising management functions
- Publication of the sanction (significant reputational damage)
- Criminal liability in cases of gross negligence

## Convergence with GDPR

It's essential to understand that **NIS2 and GDPR are complementary**, not alternatives. Security measures required by NIS2 reinforce compliance with Article 32 GDPR (processing security). In practice:

- NIS2 risk analyses must integrate GDPR impact assessments (DPIA)
- Security incidents may require **dual notification**: Data Protection Authority (GDPR) + National CSIRT (NIS2)
- Technical measures implemented serve both regulatory frameworks

## Final Recommendations

1. **Don't wait to be classified as a regulated entity**: NIS2 measures represent the new standard of professional diligence in the legal sector

2. **Invest in training**: The weakest link is often the human factor. Raising team awareness is as important as technology

3. **Document everything**: In case of an incident or inspection, documentation of measures and procedures is your best defense

4. **Consider certifications**: ISO 27001 or other certifications make it easier to demonstrate compliance

5. **Hire specialized expertise**: The technical and legal complexity of NIS2 justifies support from specialized legal cybersecurity consultants

## Conclusion

The NIS2 Directive is not just a regulatory obligation: it's an **opportunity to modernize** the technological infrastructure and processes of law firms, increasing client confidence and reducing operational risks.

Cybersecurity is no longer optional in the legal sector. Firms that adopt a proactive approach will not only avoid sanctions but will gain a **significant competitive advantage** in a market increasingly aware of digital risks.
