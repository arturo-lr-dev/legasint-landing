## Introduction

If you're thinking about developing an application or website for your business, the first question you ask yourself is: **how much will it cost?** And the honest answer is: it depends. But that doesn't mean we can't give you clear references.

In this article, we break down the real costs of development in 2026, based on our experience working with Spanish and European companies.

## Price ranges by project type

### 1. Landing page or simple corporate website
**Range:** €2,000 - €8,000

An informational website with:
- Custom design
- 5-10 pages
- Contact form
- Basic SEO optimization
- Responsive design

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks

### 2. Website with advanced features
**Range:** €8,000 - €25,000

Includes:
- Booking/appointment system
- Payment gateway integration
- Admin panel
- External services API
- Advanced SEO

**Timeline:** 1-3 months

### 3. Full web application (SaaS/Platform)
**Range:** €25,000 - €100,000+

Projects like:
- Internal management platform
- Marketplace
- Custom CRM system
- Multi-user collaborative application

**Timeline:** 3-12 months

### 4. Native mobile app (iOS + Android)

Native development with:
- Professional UX/UI design
- Custom backend
- API integration
- Push notification system
- Admin dashboard

**Timeline:** 4-12 months

### 5. MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
**Range:** €10,000 - €40,000

The "lean" version to validate your idea:
- Core functionalities
- Functional design (not premium)
- Web or mobile version (not both)
- Scalable backend

**Timeline:** 6-12 weeks

## Factors that influence cost

### 1. Technical complexity
A blog is not the same as a real-time trading platform.

**Cost increasers:**
- External system integrations (ERPs, CRMs, third-party APIs)
- Payment processing
- Advanced security (certifications, regulatory compliance)
- Real-time synchronization
- Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning

### 2. Custom design
A unique design costs more than using templates.

- **Template:** +€0 - €500
- **Semi-custom design:** €2,000 - €5,000
- **100% bespoke design:** €5,000 - €20,000

### 3. Team and location
Costs vary depending on where the team is located.

**Hourly rates in Spain (2026):**
- Junior developer: €30 - €50/h
- Mid-level developer: €50 - €80/h
- Senior developer: €80 - €120/h
- Tech lead/Architect: €120 - €180/h
- UX/UI Designer: €50 - €100/h
- Project Manager: €60 - €100/h

### 4. Maintenance and evolution
Development doesn't end with launch.

**Recurring costs:**
- Server/hosting: €50 - €500/month
- Technical maintenance: €500 - €2,000/month
- New features: as needed
- Technical support: €200 - €1,000/month

## Breakdown by phases of a typical project

Understanding how costs are distributed helps you prioritize.

### Phase 1: Discovery and planning (10-15%)
- Stakeholder meetings
- Requirements definition
- Technical architecture
- Initial wireframes and mockups

### Phase 2: UX/UI Design (15-20%)
- Interactive prototype
- Complete visual design
- Design system
- User validation

### Phase 3: Development (50-60%)
- Frontend (interface)
- Backend (business logic)
- Database
- Integrations

### Phase 4: Testing and QA (10-15%)
- Functional tests
- Performance tests
- Security testing
- Bug fixes

### Phase 5: Deploy and training (5-10%)
- Production deployment
- Server configuration
- Client team training
- Technical documentation

## Common mistakes that inflate costs

### 1. Not defining scope well at the start
Constant changes = delays = cost overruns.

**Solution:** Invest time in the discovery phase.

### 2. Wanting to do everything at once
Feature creep: adding features non-stop.

**Solution:** Start with an MVP, iterate later.

### 3. Choosing only by price
Cheap ends up expensive. Bad code = technical debt = rebuild.

**Solution:** Evaluate experience, portfolio, references.

### 4. Not planning for maintenance
Software needs updates, security, improvements.

**Solution:** Budget 15-20% annually for maintenance.

## How to optimize your investment

### 1. Start with an MVP
Validate your idea with the minimum before investing everything.

### 2. Prioritize features
Not everything is urgent. Define what's critical for launch.

### 3. Reuse where you can
Use SaaS services for secondary features (e.g., Stripe for payments, SendGrid for emails).

### 4. Plan in phases
Launch → measure → iterate. Don't develop everything before validating.

### 5. Choose the right partner
A good technical team saves you money in the long run.

## Key questions before budgeting

When talking to a consultancy, be clear on these questions:

1. **What problem does your app/website solve?**
2. **Who are your users?**
3. **What features are essential?**
4. **What's your ideal launch timeline?**
5. **Do you have a defined budget?**
6. **Do you have designs or just an idea?**
7. **Do you need to integrate with existing systems?**
8. **Who will maintain the project afterwards?**

## Conclusion

Developing software in 2026 remains a significant investment, but **when executed well, the ROI can be huge**.
