## The toughest decision when scaling your business

If your business needs technology to grow, sooner or later you'll face this question: **should I hire an internal technical team or outsource development?**

There's no universal answer. The right decision depends on your situation, resources, goals, and growth stage. In this article, we analyze both options based on practical experience working with dozens of companies.

## Outsourcing: Pros and Cons

### Advantages of Outsourcing

**1. No long-term commitment**  
You pay per project or defined period. If priorities change, you can adjust or finish without severance payments or permanent contracts.

**2. Specialized teams ready to go**  
Immediate access to developers with specific expertise (React, Node.js, Python, AI, etc.) without spending months recruiting.

**3. Predictable costs**  
Fixed budget or clear monthly rate. You know exactly how much you'll invest before starting.

**4. Less administrative overhead**  
No managing payroll, taxes, social security, holidays, sick leave, training, equipment...

**5. Resource flexibility**  
Need 3 developers this month and 1 the next? The provider adjusts the team according to project phase.

**6. Cross-industry experience**  
A consultancy has worked across different sectors and industries. They bring learnings from other similar projects.

### Disadvantages of Outsourcing

**1. Less direct control**  
You can't sit next to the developer and review code in real-time. Communication is more structured.

**2. Vendor dependency**  
If the provider disappears or the relationship deteriorates, you could get blocked (especially if code isn't well-documented or you lack full access).

**3. Learning curve on each project**  
Every time you change providers, there's an onboarding period for them to understand your business and context.

**4. Variable quality risk**  
Not all consultancies are equal. Some prioritize speed over quality, generating long-term technical debt.

**5. Limited commitment to your vision**  
An external team is on your project today, but tomorrow they might be on another. The motivation is professional, not emotional.

## In-house Team: Pros and Cons

### Advantages of In-house Team

**1. Total company alignment**  
Your team lives and breathes your product. They know the business, vision, customers. You don't need to explain context every time.

**2. Control and decision speed**  
Urgent changes, pivots, quick experiments... your team is immediately available without negotiating scope or budgets.

**3. Knowledge ownership**  
All technical knowledge (architecture, decisions, lessons learned) stays in-house. It doesn't leave with a provider when they finish.

**4. Company culture**  
An internal technical team contributes to culture, proposes improvements, gets involved in business strategy.

**5. Better for complex long-term products**  
If technology IS your business (SaaS, platform, critical app), an internal team is almost mandatory.

### Disadvantages of In-house Team

**1. High fixed cost**  
Salaries, social security, bonuses, equipment, licenses, office space... A senior developer in Spain costs between €45,000 and €70,000/year, plus associated costs. In total, it can exceed €60,000-€90,000/year per person.

**2. Slow and expensive hiring process**  
Finding, evaluating, and hiring good technical talent takes months. And if you make a mistake, the cost of firing and replacing is high.

**3. People management**  
You need a CTO or technical leader to manage the team, define architecture, review code, organize sprints, etc.

**4. Specialized talent limitations**  
If you need an expert in AI, blockchain, or specific technology, you might not find them (or afford them) in your city.

**5. Turnover risk**  
A key developer leaves and creates a hole in the project. All their product experience is lost or requires months of handover.

**6. Difficulty scaling quickly**  
Need to double the team in 2 months? With internal hiring it's nearly impossible.

## When to choose each option?

### Outsourcing is better if...

- **You're validating an idea** (MVP, early-stage product)
- **Technology is NOT your core business** (e.g., you're real estate, clinic, retail...)
- **You need speed to launch** without committing capital to a team
- **Your project has defined scope** (e.g., "I need a CRM in 4 months")
- **You lack internal technical expertise** to lead a development team
- **You want budget flexibility** and don't want high monthly fixed costs

**Real examples:**
- Startup launching MVP to validate traction before fundraising
- Traditional company digitalizing a specific process (e.g., customer portal)
- SME needing a website/app but lacking resources for CTO + team

### In-house team is better if...

- **Technology IS your business** (SaaS, platform, marketplace)
- **Your product requires continuous iteration** (weekly improvements, A/B testing, experiments)
- **You have volume and recurring budget** (>€200K/year in development)
- **You need absolute control of code and technical strategy**
- **Your product is highly technically differentiated** (e.g., proprietary algorithms, custom AI)
- **You're thinking 3-5 years ahead** and need to build a team aligned with that vision

**Real examples:**
- Fintech developing its own payment platform
- E-commerce with constant feature development and optimizations
- B2B SaaS iterating monthly based on customer feedback

## The smart solution: Hybrid model

Many successful companies combine both approaches:

### Common strategy:
1. **Start with outsourcing** to validate the idea and launch MVP quickly
2. **Hire an internal technical leader** (CTO, Lead Developer) to oversee the provider
3. **Gradually internalize** development when you have traction and resources
4. **Keep outsourcing for specific tasks**: design, QA, DevOps, non-core features

### Hybrid structure example:
- **Internal team:** 1 CTO + 2 fullstack developers (core product)
- **Outsourcing:** UI/UX design, cloud infrastructure, specific integrations

**Benefits:**
- Control and agility in critical areas (internal team)
- Flexibility and expertise in secondary areas (outsourcing)
- Optimized costs without losing responsiveness

## Key questions to decide

Before making the decision, answer:

1. **What's my available budget?** (monthly/annual)
2. **How long can I wait to have an operational team?**
3. **Does my product need continuous evolution or is it a finite project?**
4. **Do I have someone internal with technical knowledge to lead?**
5. **What if the project fails? Can I afford fixed costs?**
6. **Does my business DEPEND on this technology or is it support?**

## Practical conclusion

**There's no universally correct answer.** The key is aligning the decision with your context:

- **If you're starting out, validate with outsourcing.** It's faster, more flexible, and less risky.
- **If your technology is strategic, invest in an internal team.** But not before validating traction.
- **Combine both approaches intelligently.** They're not mutually exclusive options.

**A final reflection:**  
The biggest mistake isn't choosing wrong between outsourcing or in-house team. **The biggest mistake is choosing the wrong provider or talent.** Whether external or internal, team quality is what really makes the difference.
