## The real case that changes everything

A client came to us a few months ago with a situation we've seen more than once: they tried to build their management platform using ChatGPT as their "virtual developer." Three months, €15,000 in internal time, and a product that didn't work in production.

It wasn't that they did anything wrong. It's that nobody explained what AI is actually good for — and what it's not.

This article is the manual nobody gave them.

## What AI does very well (and you should take advantage of)

Let's be honest: ChatGPT, Claude, and the rest of the generative AI models are powerful tools. For certain tasks, they can dramatically accelerate a developer's work.

### Rapid prototyping

Want to see if an idea works visually before committing budget? AI can generate a functional interface in minutes. Perfect for validating with clients or investors before spending real money.

### Automating repetitive tasks

Scripts to export data from your CRM, transform a CSV, send emails in bulk, generate PDF reports. Moderate automation tasks where the margin for error doesn't compromise critical data.

### First drafts of documentation

User guides, internal FAQs, process documentation. AI speeds up the base writing that you then refine.

### Support for developers

Here's the key point most people miss: **AI doesn't replace developers — it makes them up to 3x faster**. A good developer with access to AI tools delivers more in less time. That translates into cheaper and faster projects for you.

## What AI cannot do (yet)

And this is where many businesses get burned.

### Serious software architecture

Deciding how to structure a database to scale from 100 to 100,000 users, choosing between microservices or monolith, planning for the system to be maintainable in 3 years... this requires technical judgment, experience, and accountability. AI can suggest, but it can't be responsible.

### Security and data privacy

Does your app handle customer data? Payments? Sensitive information? Generative AI can produce code that works... and has serious vulnerabilities. An expert developer knows where the traps are.

### Integrations with external systems

Connecting your app to Salesforce, SAP, banking systems, third-party APIs with poor or changing documentation. AI gets lost quickly here, and the debugging time can exceed what building from scratch would have taken.

### Maintenance and evolution

Code generated by AI without supervision tends to be hard to maintain. It doesn't follow team conventions, it's poorly documented, it mixes approaches. The long-term cost can be significant.

### Real accountability

If something breaks, who answers for it? The OpenAI API? A developer or development company has a contract, a guarantee, and skin in the game. AI doesn't.

## The framework for making the decision

Before deciding whether to use AI directly or hire development, ask yourself these questions:

**1. What happens if this fails?**
- Low consequences (an incorrect internal report) → AI might be enough
- High consequences (customer data loss, failed transactions) → you need a professional

**2. How long will this live?**
- One-week prototype → go ahead with AI
- System you'll use for 5 years → invest in real development

**3. Does it involve critical data?**
- Sensitive, financial, or health data → always a developer
- Low-risk internal automation → AI can help

**4. Does someone need to maintain it?**
- If nobody on your team can read the code → problem in the medium term
- If you have a technical team that can supervise → AI can complement

## The hybrid model that actually works

The answer isn't "one or the other." The most efficient model in 2026 is:

**AI for speed + Developer for judgment and accountability**

Concrete examples:
- Developer uses AI to generate 60% of the code → you pay fewer hours
- AI prototypes the interface → developer connects it to the real backend securely
- AI automates simple internal tasks → developer builds the main system

The result: faster and cheaper projects without sacrificing quality or security.

## What should you do right now?

Depends on where you are:

**If you want to explore an idea:**
Start with AI tools or no-code (Bubble, Webflow) to validate. If the idea holds up, take the leap to real development.

**If you have a project that "works with patches":**
Technical audit first. Often, AI-generated code needs refactoring before it can scale.

**If you need something solid for your business:**
Work with a development company that uses AI in their internal process. You get the best of both worlds: AI speed, expert judgment.

**If you already have a technical team:**
Give them access to good AI tools. Your team becomes more productive without growing headcount.

## Conclusion

ChatGPT is not going to replace developers. But businesses that understand how to combine AI with technical talent will have a real advantage over those still working like it's 2020.

The question isn't "AI or developer?" The question is: **which tool is right for which part of my problem?**

If you have doubts about how to apply this to your specific project, at Legasint we do that analysis with you. No technical jargon, no selling you what you don't need.
