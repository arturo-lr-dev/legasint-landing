## Introduction

The **European Union's AI Regulation** (AI Act) came into force in 2024, and by 2026, its main provisions are fully applicable. For law firms and legal services in Spain, this means new compliance obligations, but also strategic opportunities to differentiate in the market.

In this article, we analyze **what the AI Act concretely means for your legal practice**, which AI systems are considered high-risk in the legal context, and how to ensure regulatory compliance without sacrificing innovation.

## What is the AI Act and Why Does it Matter to Lawyers?

The AI Act is the **first comprehensive regulatory framework on artificial intelligence** worldwide. It establishes a risk-based approach, classifying AI systems into four categories:

1. **Unacceptable risk** - Prohibited (e.g., social scoring)
2. **High risk** - Require rigorous conformity assessment
3. **Limited risk** - Transparency obligations
4. **Minimal risk** - No special obligations

For the legal sector, most AI applications fall into the **high-risk** or **limited-risk** categories, which entail specific obligations for documentation, transparency, and human oversight.

## High-Risk AI Systems in Legal Services

The AI Act considers **high-risk** AI systems used by public authorities or on their behalf for:

- **Assistance in interpretation and application of law**
- **Evaluation of appeals and claims**
- **Support for judicial decisions**

### What Does This Mean for Your Firm?

If you use AI tools for:

- **Predictive case analysis** (predicting judicial outcomes)
- **Automated contract review** with binding recommendations
- **Legal risk assessment** in corporate operations
- **Assistance in administrative or judicial proceedings**

Your system is likely considered **high-risk** and you must comply with strict requirements.

## Obligations for Providers and Users of Legal AI

### If You Develop or Customize AI (Provider)

1. **Conformity assessment** before deployment
2. Continuous and documented **risk management**
3. **Data governance**: ensure quality and representativeness
4. **Complete technical documentation**
5. **Registration in EU database** of high-risk systems
6. Effective **human oversight** in design
7. **Transparency and traceability** of decisions

### If You Use Third-Party AI (User)

1. **Verify CE certification** from provider
2. **Implement effective human oversight**
3. **Monitor functioning** and detect anomalies
4. **Maintain usage logs** for determined period
5. **Inform affected parties** when AI is used in decisions
6. **Cooperate with authorities** in case of inspection

## Transparency: Informing Clients is Mandatory

One of the most relevant novelties is the **transparency obligation**:

> **Users must be informed when they interact with an AI system**, especially if it contributes to decisions that affect them.

**In practice:**

- If you use AI to **review contracts**, you must inform the client
- If you employ **legal chatbots**, it must be clear it's not a human
- If you apply **predictive analysis** in a procedural strategy, the client has the right to know

**Best practices:**

generated by AI are reviewed and validated by licensed attorneys 
before delivery."

## Human Oversight: AI Assists, Doesn't Decide

The AI Act requires high-risk systems to include mechanisms for **effective human oversight**. In legal services, this means:

### What you CANNOT do:

- ❌ Delegate strategic decisions exclusively to AI
- ❌ Use AI recommendations without professional review
- ❌ Automate legal responses without human intervention

### What you SHOULD do:

- ✅ Review all AI outputs before communicating them to client
- ✅ Maintain override capability (override AI decisions)
- ✅ Train team on AI limitations and biases
- ✅ Document how human oversight is integrated

### Practical Example: Due Diligence with AI

```
1. AI analyzes 500 contracts and detects risk clauses
   ↓
2. Senior lawyer reviews generated alerts
   ↓
3. Lawyer validates findings and adds legal context
   ↓
4. Final report delivered with professional seal
```

## Legal Liability: Who is Responsible if AI Makes a Mistake?

The AI Act **does not exempt** legal professionals from liability:

- **Civil liability** still rests with the lawyer/firm
- AI is a **tool**, like a digital civil code or database
- The **duty of care** now includes verifying AI reliability

**Recommendation:** Include clauses in your **professional liability insurance policies** that cover the use of AI tools.

## Opportunities: AI as a Regulated Competitive Advantage

Complying with the AI Act is not just an obligation, it's also a **differentiation opportunity**:

### Certification advantages:

1. **Client trust**: Demonstrating regulatory compliance generates security
2. **Competitive advantage**: Few firms are certified yet
3. **Operational efficiency**: Implementing governance improves internal processes
4. **Access to public tenders**: More and more competitions require certified AI

### Compliant and profitable use cases:

- **Automated jurisprudential research** (limited risk)
- **Generation of first drafts** with human review
- **Analysis of document volumes** in litigation
- **Multilingual legal translation** with professional validation

## AI Act Implementation Timeline

| Date | Obligation |
|-------|------------|
| **August 2024** | Prohibition of unacceptable risk AI systems |
| **February 2025** | Obligations for general-purpose AI models (GPT-4, etc.) |
| **August 2026** | **Full applicability for high-risk systems** |
| **August 2027** | Obligations for AI systems already on the market |

**We are in March 2026**, so you have **5 months** to ensure compliance if you use high-risk AI.
