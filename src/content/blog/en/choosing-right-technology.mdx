## 🎯 How to Choose the Right Technology for Your Project Without Being Technical

One of the biggest barriers non-technical entrepreneurs face is **how to make technology decisions without feeling lost**.

React or Vue? Cloud or own server? Native app or web?

The good news: **you don't need to understand code to make smart decisions**. You just need to ask the right questions.

## 🔑 Key principles before deciding

### 1. Define WHAT you need first, not HOW

Before thinking about technology, answer:
- What problem does this project solve?
- Who will use it?
- What should it be able to do?
- How many users do you expect (initially and in 1 year)?
- Does it need to work offline?

**Example:**
❌ "I want an app in React Native"
✅ "I need my customers to be able to book appointments from their mobile, even offline, and receive automatic reminders"

### 2. Think evolution, not perfection

You don't need the definitive solution from day one. You need:
- **Something that works quickly** (to validate your idea)
- **Something that can grow with you** (without starting from scratch)
- **Something you can maintain** (or delegate without depending on a single person)

### 3. Value the balance between cost and flexibility

| Option | Advantage | Disadvantage |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **No-code tools** (Webflow, Bubble) | Fast, cheap, no code | Customization limits |
| **Templates/themes** (WordPress, Shopify) | Ideal balance to start | May fall short when growing |
| **Custom development** | 100% adapted | More expensive, slower |

**General rule:** Start simple. Scale when necessary, not "just in case."

## ❓ Key questions to evaluate technical proposals

When a developer or agency presents you with a solution, ask:

### About the proposed technology:
1. **Why do you recommend this specific technology?**
   - They should explain it in simple language, not jargon.

2. **What happens if we need to change something in 6 months?**
   - You want flexibility, not to be tied to a single person or company.

3. **How long has this technology been on the market?**
   - The "very latest" can be unstable. Very old can be obsolete.

4. **Are there other similar projects built with this?**
   - Real references > promises.

### About maintenance and ownership:
5. **Who owns the code and data?**
   - **YOU** must be the owner. Always.

6. **What happens if the person/company that builds it disappears?**
   - Could another developer continue?

7. **How much does it cost to keep it running each month?**
   - Hosting, licenses, updates... it all adds up.

### About scalability:
8. **What happens if I have 10x more users than expected?**
   - It should be able to grow without collapsing.

9. **Can I start simple and add features later?**
   - Incremental building > all at once.

## 🚩 Warning signs (red flags)

❌ **"This is the only way to do it"**
→ There are always alternatives. Ask about other options.

❌ **"Don't worry about the technical details"**
→ You don't need to know EVERYTHING, but you should understand important decisions.

❌ **"We build it with proprietary technology"**
→ Careful: you may be tied to that company forever.

❌ **"This can't be changed later"**
→ If something isn't flexible, reconsider the architecture.

❌ **Budget without breakdown**
→ Demand transparency: what each stage includes and how much it costs.

## ✅ Criteria to make the right decision

### For an MVP (first 6 months):
- ✅ Development speed
- ✅ Contained cost
- ✅ Easy to iterate quickly
- ⚠️ Scalability (important, but not priority)

### For a consolidated product (after validation):
- ✅ Proven scalability
- ✅ Active community (easy to find developers)
- ✅ Robust security
- ✅ Flexibility to evolve

## 🛠️ Practical examples

### Case 1: Online store
**Need:** Sell physical products with shipping.

**Option 1 - Shopify:**
- ✅ Quick to set up
- ✅ Everything integrated (payments, shipping)
- ❌ Limited in advanced customization
- **Ideal for:** Starting in weeks

**Option 2 - WordPress + WooCommerce:**
- ✅ More flexible than Shopify
- ✅ Lower monthly cost
- ❌ Requires more technical maintenance
- **Ideal for:** Total control without ties

**Option 3 - Custom development:**
- ✅ 100% adapted to unique needs
- ❌ More expensive and slow
- **Ideal for:** Complex business models

### Case 2: Mobile service app
**Need:** App to book services (Uber/Glovo type).

**Option 1 - PWA (Web App):**
- ✅ Works on iOS and Android from a single code
- ✅ No app stores needed
- ❌ Limitations in native features (camera, advanced GPS)
- **Ideal for:** Quick validation

**Option 2 - React Native / Flutter:**
- ✅ Native app with real performance
- ✅ One code for both platforms
- ❌ More complex and expensive than PWA
- **Ideal for:** Scalable product

**Option 3 - Native (Swift + Kotlin):**
- ✅ Maximum performance and access to everything
- ❌ Double development (iOS and Android separately)
- **Ideal for:** Very demanding apps (games, editing)

## 🎯 Final checklist: Is it the right technology?

Answer YES to most before deciding:

- [ ] Does it solve my current problem?
- [ ] Can I afford to develop and maintain it?
- [ ] Are developers available in the market?
- [ ] Can I change providers if necessary?
- [ ] Is the community still active? (updates, support)
- [ ] Do other similar projects use it successfully?
- [ ] Do I understand recurring costs (hosting, licenses)?
- [ ] Can I start simple and evolve?

## 🌟 Conclusion

**You don't need to be technical to make smart technology decisions.**

You need:
- Clarity about your objective
- Right questions
- Honest advice (not disguised sales)
- Common sense

The best technology isn't the most modern or most expensive. **It's the one that helps you achieve your goal without tying your hands for the future**.
