## Introduction

The **European Union's Artificial Intelligence Regulation (AI Act)** came into force in 2024, and in 2026, we find ourselves in the midst of implementing its most demanding obligations. For law firms and legal professionals who use or develop AI tools, understanding this regulatory framework is not optional: it's essential.

This article provides a practical guide on how the AI Act affects legal services and what steps firms must take to ensure compliance.

## What is the AI Act?

The AI Act is the world's first comprehensive regulatory framework specifically designed for artificial intelligence. Its approach is based on **risk levels**, classifying AI systems into four categories:

- **Unacceptable risk**: Prohibited (e.g., social scoring systems)
- **High risk**: Strict compliance requirements
- **Limited risk**: Transparency obligations
- **Minimal risk**: No specific requirements

## AI Systems in Legal Services

### Common Tools in the Sector

Modern law firms use AI for multiple functions:

1. **Predictive litigation analytics** - Estimate success probabilities
2. **Automated contract review** - Identify problematic clauses
3. **AI-assisted legal research** - Search case law and doctrine
4. **Virtual legal assistants** - Chatbots for initial consultations
5. **Document automation** - Generation of briefs and templates

### Risk Classification

Under the AI Act, most legal tools fall between **limited and high risk**, depending on:

- Does it make decisions that directly affect fundamental rights?
- Is it used in processes to evaluate individuals?
- Does it impact access to essential services?

> **Critical example:** An AI system that evaluates client solvency for pro bono cases could be classified as **high risk** if it automatically determines access to legal representation.

## Obligations for Law Firms

### 1. Identification and Classification

**Required action:**
- Inventory all AI systems in use
- Classify each tool according to risk level
- Document the use and purpose of each system

```markdown
**Inventory Checklist:**
- [ ] Document analysis tools
- [ ] AI-powered case management platforms
- [ ] Customer service chatbots
- [ ] Predictive analysis systems
- [ ] Automated document generators
```

### 2. Conformity Assessment (High-Risk Systems)

If your firm develops or uses **high-risk** systems, you must:

- **Conduct impact assessments** on fundamental rights
- **Implement documented risk management systems**
- **Ensure data quality** (accuracy, representativeness, bias)
- **Maintain detailed technical records**
- **Establish effective human oversight**

### 3. Transparency and Client Rights

**Information obligations:**

Clients have the right to know when they interact with AI or when their cases are analyzed by automated systems. This implies:

- **Clear notices** about AI use in service delivery
- **Understandable explanation** of AI's role in the process
- **Right to human review** of automated decisions

**Practical example:**

If you use AI to review contracts, you must inform the client that:
1. Initial analysis is performed by an automated system
2. Results are supervised by a lawyer
3. They can request exclusively human review

### 4. Data Management and Privacy

The AI Act complements **GDPR**. Firms must:

- Ensure training data complies with data protection
- Implement **privacy by design** measures
- Conduct **Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA)** when appropriate
- Guarantee ARCO rights (access, rectification, erasure, objection)

## Practical Cases in the Spanish Legal Sector

### Case 1: Boutique Firm with Chatbot

**Situation:** A 5-lawyer firm implements a chatbot for initial consultations.

**Classification:** Limited risk (doesn't make binding decisions)

**Obligations:**
- Clearly inform it's an automated system
- Allow access to human attention at any time
- Don't allow it to make decisions about client acceptance

### Case 2: Large Firm with Predictive AI

**Situation:** 200+ lawyer firm uses AI to predict litigation outcomes.

**Classification:** Potentially high risk (affects legal strategy)

**Obligations:**
- Complete conformity assessment
- Exhaustive system documentation
- Mandatory human oversight of predictions
- Periodic bias and accuracy audits

### Case 3: Spanish LegalTech Developer

**Situation:** Startup developing automated due diligence software.

**Classification:** High-risk system provider

**Obligations:**
- CE conformity certification
- Quality management system
- Complete technical documentation
- Post-market surveillance

## Penalties for Non-Compliance

The AI Act establishes **significant fines**:

- Up to **€35 million** or **7% of global turnover** (prohibitions)
- Up to **€15 million** or **3% of turnover** (high-risk systems)
- Up to **€7.5 million** or **1.5% of turnover** (other infringements)

For a law firm, even minor sanctions can be devastating.

## Practical Steps for Compliance

### Roadmap for Law Firms

**Phase 1: Audit (1-2 months)**
1. Identify all AI systems in use
2. Classify by risk level
3. Review contracts with technology providers

**Phase 2: Assessment (2-3 months)**
4. Conduct impact assessments for high-risk systems
5. Identify compliance gaps
6. Evaluate team training needs

**Phase 3: Implementation (3-6 months)**
7. Develop policies and procedures
8. Update privacy notices and terms of service
9. Implement human oversight controls
10. Establish documentation processes

**Phase 4: Monitoring (ongoing)**
11. Periodic system audits
12. Updates for regulatory changes
13. Continuous team training

### Required Resources

- **Designate an AI officer** (can be the DPO or similar)
- **Specialized training** for the legal team
- **Documentation and logging tools**
- **Technical advice** (if developing AI internally)

## The Lawyer's Role in the AI Era

The AI Act doesn't seek to halt innovation, but to **ensure AI is developed ethically and safely**. For lawyers, this means:

- **Critical oversight** of AI tools
- **Basic technical understanding** of how systems work
- **Ultimate responsibility** for decisions affecting clients
- **Transparency** as a fundamental value

> AI is a powerful tool, but legal judgment, professional ethics, and human empathy remain irreplaceable.

## Conclusions

The AI Act represents a paradigm shift in how we use technology in the legal sector. Firms that adopt a proactive approach will not only avoid sanctions but gain competitive advantage by:

- **Building trust** with clients through transparency
- **Reducing operational and reputational risks**
- **Optimizing processes** with compliant AI from design
- **Differentiating themselves** as responsible and modern firms

The key is to act now: AI Act compliance is not a one-time event, but an ongoing process of adaptation and improvement.
