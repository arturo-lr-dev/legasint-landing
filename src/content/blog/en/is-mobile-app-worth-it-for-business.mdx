## The million-dollar question

"Do I need an app?" is one of the most common questions we get at **LegaSint**. And the honest answer is: **it depends**. Not all businesses need a mobile app, but some can truly transform their operations with one.

In this article, I'll help you make that decision based on facts, not hype.

## When a mobile app DOES make sense

### 1. Frequent and recurring use

If your customers interact with your service **several times a week** (or even daily), an app makes sense:

- **Example:** Delivery apps, banks, gyms with booking systems, subscription services
- **Why it works:** The app stays on the user's phone, just one tap away

### 2. You need device-specific features

Does your service benefit from:
- **Push notifications** (reminders, offers, real-time updates)
- **Camera** (QR scanning, documents, product photos)
- **GPS** (location, routes, nearby services)
- **Offline access** (check info without connection)
- **Mobile payments** (Apple Pay, Google Pay)

If you check 2 or more, an app can give you a competitive edge.

### 3. You want to build loyalty and retain customers

Apps enable:
- **Loyalty programs** (points, coupons, tiers)
- **Personalized experience** (history, saved preferences)
- **Direct communication** (relevant notifications, not spam)

> "A well-designed app increases customer retention by 20-30% compared to just having a website." - InMobi Study, 2025

### 4. Your competitors have apps (and they work)

If your industry has already adopted mobile apps and your customers **expect** one, not having it can be a disadvantage.

**But beware:** Don't copy for copying's sake. Make sure it truly adds value.

## When you DON'T need an app

### 1. Your audience visits sporadically

If your customers use your service 1-2 times a year (like buying a car, hiring a lawyer, renewing insurance), **a responsive website is enough**.

**Reason:** They won't download an app to use it once. And if they do, they'll delete it after first use.

### 2. Your mobile website already works well

**Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)** are websites that behave like apps:
- Can be installed on the phone
- Work offline
- Send push notifications (on Android)
- Cost less than a native app

**Success examples:** Twitter Lite, Starbucks PWA

If your website is mobile-optimized and covers your needs, an app might be unnecessary.

### 3. You don't have resources to maintain it

An app isn't "publish and forget":
- **Constant updates** (iOS/Android release new versions)
- **Bug fixes**
- **New features** based on feedback
- **Compatibility** with new devices

If you don't have budget to maintain the app for at least 2-3 years, **better not to start**.

## How much does a mobile app actually cost?

Here are real numbers (Spain/EU, 2026):

### Basic app (MVP)
- **Development:** €15,000 - €30,000
- **Time:** 3-5 months
- **Includes:** Login, profile, core functionality, basic design

### Medium complexity app
- **Development:** €30,000 - €70,000
- **Time:** 5-9 months
- **Includes:** Robust backend, API integrations, push notifications, payments

### Complex app
- **Development:** €70,000+
- **Time:** 9-15 months
- **Includes:** Multiple roles, real-time features, AI/ML, scalable infrastructure

**And don't forget:**
- **Annual maintenance:** 15-20% of development cost
- **Publishing fees:** €25/year (Google Play) + €99/year (App Store)

## Alternatives before building an app

### 1. Improve your mobile website

Optimize first:
- Load speed (< 3 seconds)
- Responsive design adapted to mobile
- Easy-to-fill forms on small screens
- Direct contact buttons (WhatsApp, phone)

**Cost:** €2,000 - €8,000

### 2. Progressive Web App (PWA)

The middle ground between website and app:
- Same codebase as your website
- Can be "installed" on the phone
- Works offline
- Cheaper than native app

**Cost:** €8,000 - €20,000

### 3. Hybrid app (React Native, Flutter)

One codebase for iOS + Android:
- Cheaper than two native apps
- Similar functionality to native apps
- Faster to develop

**Cost:** 20% - 40% less than two native apps

### 4. No-code / Low-code

Platforms like FlutterFlow, Adalo, Bubble for simple apps:
- **Pros:** Fast, cheap, no coding
- **Cons:** Limited, platform-dependent, restricted scalability

**Cost:** €500 - €5,000 (+ monthly subscription)

## How to make the decision

**Ask yourself these questions:**

1. Would my customers use the app **at least weekly**?
2. Do I need device-specific features (GPS, camera, notifications)?
3. Is my current mobile website insufficient for what I need to do?
4. Do I have budget for development **and long-term maintenance**?
5. Do my competitors have apps and do my customers value them?

**If you answered YES to 3 or more:** An app probably makes sense.

**If you answered NO to most:** Start by optimizing your mobile website or consider a PWA.

## Real case: LegaSint client

**Context:** Medical clinic chain with 8 centers in Spain.

**Initial problem:** "We need an app for patients to book appointments."

**Our recommendation:** Responsive web system + SMS notifications.

**Why?**
- Patients book appointments 2-4 times a year (sporadic use)
- They don't need device features (camera, GPS, etc.)
- An app would require constant maintenance
- Cost-benefit didn't justify development

**Result:**
- Optimized mobile website: €6,000
- Appointment system integrated with their medical software
- Automatic SMS notifications (24h reminders)
- **Savings:** €20,000+ vs native app

Patients are happy, clinic too. The most technological solution isn't always the best.

## Conclusion: Not all businesses need an app

A mobile app can be an excellent investment if:
- Your business needs frequent interaction
- You require device-specific features
- You want to build loyalty and differentiate

But it can also be an unnecessary expense if:
- Your mobile website already works well
- Usage is sporadic
- You don't have resources to maintain it

**My advice:** Always start with the simplest solution and scale only when needed. A good mobile website or PWA can take you very far.
