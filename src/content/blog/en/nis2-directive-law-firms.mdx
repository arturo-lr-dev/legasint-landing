## Introduction

The **NIS2 Directive** (EU Directive 2022/2555) has revolutionized the European cybersecurity landscape, establishing rigorous requirements that directly affect law firms in Spain and across the EU. Following its national transposition in 2024, legal practices must now assess whether they fall within its scope and, if so, implement comprehensive technical and organizational measures.

This article examines the practical implications of NIS2 for the legal sector, applicability criteria, and immediate actions that law firms should consider in 2026.

## What is the NIS2 Directive?

The NIS2 Directive significantly expands the scope of its predecessor (NIS1), establishing a common cybersecurity framework across the European Union. Its goal is to improve resilience and incident response capabilities in critical and essential sectors.

### Key Changes from NIS1

- **Sectoral expansion:** From 7 to 18 covered sectors
- **Size criteria:** Application based on employee and revenue thresholds
- **Stricter sanctions:** Up to €10 million or 2% of annual global turnover
- **Supply chain:** Obligation to assess risks in critical suppliers
- **Governance:** Personal liability for management bodies

## When Does NIS2 Apply to Law Firms?

Not all law firms are subject to NIS2, but many may be indirectly affected:

### Direct Application

Law firms **may be considered essential or important entities** if they:

1. **Provide services to critical infrastructure:** Clients in sectors such as energy, transport, banking, healthcare, or public administration
2. **Exceed size thresholds:**
   - Important entities: 50+ employees and €10M+ revenue
   - Essential entities: Specific sector-based criteria
3. **Manage critical information:** Sensitive data related to national security or essential services

### Indirect Application (Supply Chain)

Even if a firm is not directly obligated, it may be affected if:

- **Its clients are subject to NIS2** and require cybersecurity audits of their legal providers
- **It subcontracts IT services** to providers that must comply with NIS2
- **It participates in due diligence processes** where cybersecurity is a critical factor

## Key Compliance Requirements

### 1. Technical and Organizational Measures

Firms subject to NIS2 must implement:

#### Risk Management
- Periodic cybersecurity risk assessments
- Impact analysis on critical systems and data
- Incident management policies

#### System Security
- Encryption of data at rest and in transit
- Mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Network segmentation and access control
- Backup and disaster recovery systems

#### Human Resources
- Mandatory cybersecurity training for all staff
- Acceptable use policies for systems
- Privilege and access management

### 2. Incident Notification

**Strict deadlines:**
- **24 hours:** Early warning to competent authority (INCIBE in Spain)
- **72 hours:** Incident notification with initial analysis
- **1 month:** Final report with corrective measures

**Types of notifiable incidents:**
- Personal data breaches
- Significant service disruptions
- Ransomware or malware attacks
- Unauthorized access to critical systems

### 3. Supply Chain

Firms must:
- **Assess cybersecurity of critical suppliers** (cloud services, IT, legal software)
- **Include security clauses** in third-party contracts
- **Regularly audit** supplier compliance

### 4. Governance and Accountability

**Obligations for partners and management:**
- Formally approve cybersecurity policies
- Oversee implementation of measures
- Participate in specialized training
- **Personal liability** in case of serious non-compliance

## Sanctions and Consequences

NIS2 non-compliance may result in:

### Administrative Sanctions
- **Essential entities:** Up to €10M or 2% of annual global turnover
- **Important entities:** Up to €7M or 1.4% of annual global turnover

### Additional Penalties
- Temporary ban from holding management positions
- Public disclosure of non-compliance (reputational damage)
- Mandatory audits at the violator's expense

### Civil Liability
- Client claims for data breaches
- Damages for service disruptions
- Loss of ISO certifications or quality seals

## Compliance Roadmap

### Phase 1: Assessment (1-2 months)

1. **Determine applicability:**
   - Does the firm meet size criteria?
   - Does it provide services to critical entities?
   - Do clients require NIS2 compliance?

2. **Asset inventory:**
   - Case management systems
   - Client databases
   - Cloud services (email, storage)
   - Critical applications

3. **Gap analysis:**
   - Compare current state vs. NIS2 requirements
   - Identify priority vulnerabilities

### Phase 2: Implementation (3-6 months)

1. **Policies and procedures:**
   - Cybersecurity policy
   - Incident response plan
   - Supplier management policy

2. **Technical measures:**
   - MFA deployment
   - Sensitive data encryption
   - Backup and recovery solutions
   - Intrusion detection systems (IDS/IPS)

3. **Training:**
   - Initial training for all staff
   - Phishing simulations
   - Specialized training for partners

### Phase 3: Continuous Monitoring

- **Internal audits:** Quarterly or semi-annual
- **Supplier review:** Annual
- **Policy updates:** Based on threat evolution
- **Response exercises:** Annual incident simulations

## Practical Recommendations

### For Small Firms (< 50 employees)

Even if not directly obligated:
- **Adopt basic best practices:** MFA, backups, training
- **Review contracts with large clients** that may require audits
- **Evaluate managed cybersecurity services** (more economical than in-house team)

### For Medium and Large Firms

- **Appoint a cybersecurity officer** (may be external)
- **Get ISO 27001 certified** (complements NIS2 and builds credibility)
- **Automate incident management** with SIEM tools
- **Review cyber insurance clauses** (ransomware coverage, notifications)

### Collaboration with IT Providers

- **Choose certified cloud providers** (ENS, ISO 27001, SOC 2)
- **Demand transparency** about data location and security measures
- **Negotiate specific security SLAs** and response times

## Conclusion

The NIS2 Directive represents a paradigm shift in how law firms must approach cybersecurity. It is no longer merely a technical matter but a legal requirement with direct implications for governance and partner liability.

In 2026, NIS2 compliance not only protects against administrative sanctions but has become a **competitive differentiator**. Institutional and corporate clients increasingly prioritize legal providers that demonstrate cybersecurity maturity.

Investment in NIS2 compliance should be viewed as an investment in the firm's long-term resilience and reputation. Acting now, proactively, is significantly more efficient than reacting after a security incident.
