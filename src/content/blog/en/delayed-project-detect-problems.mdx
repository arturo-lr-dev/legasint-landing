## The silent problem

"Everything is going well," your development provider tells you. But two months have passed beyond the initial deadline and you still don't see tangible results. **Software project delays are more the norm than the exception**, but the difference between a manageable delay and a project that becomes a bottomless pit lies in detecting the warning signs early.

At LegaSInt, we've rescued dozens of projects that came to us in critical states. In this article, we share the most common warning signs and concrete actions to take.

## Warning signs: when to worry

### 1. Lack of transparency in progress

**Warning signs:**
- Updates are vague: "We're making good progress"
- No demonstrations of actual work
- Follow-up meetings are frequently canceled or postponed
- You don't have access to project management tools (Jira, Trello, etc.)

**What to do:**
Demand immediate visibility. A healthy project should have:
- Accessible code repository (GitHub, GitLab)
- Weekly or biweekly demos of the working product
- Updated progress dashboard
- Clear metrics (completed stories, open bugs, etc.)

> "If you can't see the code or real progress, you're not buying software, you're buying promises."

### 2. Constant changes in estimates

**Warning signs:**
- Every week "unforeseen issues" appear that add time
- Initial estimates multiply without clear explanation
- Scope grows uncontrollably (scope creep)
- There's no clear new delivery date

**What to do:**
- **Freeze the scope:** Define what is MVP (minimum viable product) and what can wait
- **Demand a recovery plan:** How they plan to resolve the delay
- **Review the contract:** Are there penalties for delay? Exit clauses?

### 3. One-way communication

**Warning signs:**
- Your questions are answered with days of delay
- There's no clear point of contact on the team
- You feel like a "nuisance" when asking about project status
- Responses are defensive or evasive

**What to do:**
A healthy client-provider relationship is **collaborative, not adversarial**. If you feel you'd be "bothering" them by asking about your own project, something is wrong. Establish:
- Mandatory weekly meetings with agenda
- Direct communication channel (Slack, Teams, etc.)
- Maximum response times (e.g., 24h for urgent queries)

### 4. Unstable team

**Warning signs:**
- You're introduced to a new developer every month
- The "tech lead" is no longer on the project
- You notice high turnover at the provider
- Each new person asks you to explain everything from scratch

**What to do:**
**Team continuity is critical**. An occasional change is normal, but constant changes are a giant red flag. Ask:
- Who is the stable team assigned to my project?
- Is there detailed technical documentation of the project?
- What happens if a key person leaves?

### 5. "Unexpected" technical problems

**Warning signs:**
- "Technical debt" appears that nobody mentioned at the start
- They need to "rewrite" parts already "finished"
- Integrations "turned out more complex than thought"
- Performance issues that "nobody anticipated"

**What to do:**
These problems should be identified in the **planning phase**, not halfway through development. If they appear, demand:
- Independent technical evaluation (second opinion)
- Remediation plan with dates
- Understanding if it's lack of experience or poor planning

## Concrete actions when you detect problems

### Step 1: Quick audit

Before making drastic decisions, do an objective assessment:

```bash
Project health checklist:
□ Do you have access to the code?
□ Is the code documented?
□ Are there automated tests?
□ Is anything working in production or staging?
□ Does technical documentation exist?
□ Does the team respond in less than 48h?
```

If more than 50% are "NO", you're in the danger zone.

### Step 2: Crisis meeting

Schedule an escalation meeting with:
- Provider's project director
- Tech lead
- Your internal team (if it exists)

**Agenda:**
1. Real project status (unfiltered)
2. Reasons for delay
3. Concrete recovery plan
4. New deliverables and dates
5. How to prevent recurrence

### Step 3: Redefine tracking

If you decide to continue with the current provider:
- **Mandatory weekly demos:** See working functionalities
- **Full access:** Code, tools, documentation
- **Weekly metrics:** Velocity, bugs, completeness
- **Point of no return:** Absolute deadline to see real progress

### Step 4: Plan B

In parallel, prepare alternatives:
- Evaluate other providers
- Consider hiring an interim CTO to audit
- Assess if you need to rescue the project (continue with another team)

## When to cut your losses

There are situations where it's better to **stop the project** than continue:

- ✂️ **You're 200% over initial budget** without a working product
- ✂️ **Provider refuses to give you access to the code**
- ✂️ **6+ months have passed without usable deliveries**
- ✂️ **You detect lack of real technical capacity** in the team
- ✂️ **Communication is hostile or non-existent**

> "It's not failure to recognize that a project is going badly. Failure is continuing to invest in something that has no solution."

## How to avoid this in future projects

**Before hiring:**
- ✅ Verifiable references (talk to real clients)
- ✅ Portfolio with similar projects
- ✅ Clear and documented development process
- ✅ Stable team assigned from the start
- ✅ Contract with clear milestones and penalties

**During development:**
- ✅ Regular progress demonstrations
- ✅ Full access to tools and code
- ✅ Fluid and proactive communication
- ✅ Continuous technical documentation

## Conclusion

Software project delays are common, but **you don't have to accept them without question**. Transparency, honest communication, and objective metrics are your best tools to maintain control.

If your project is already in trouble, act fast: every month that passes, the cost of rescuing it increases exponentially. And remember: **a good provider will alert you to problems before they become crises**.

At LegaSInt we work with total transparency: access to code from day one, weekly demos, and daily communication. If you need a second opinion on your current project, [let's talk](https://legasint.com/contact).
